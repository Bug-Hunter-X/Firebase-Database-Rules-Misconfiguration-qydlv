The Firebase SDK may throw an error if the rules in your Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore are not configured correctly. This can result in unexpected behavior or your app not functioning as intended.  For example, if your rules are too restrictive, your app might not be able to read or write data. If your rules are too permissive, your data might be exposed to unauthorized users.
